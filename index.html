    <h1>My Hobby</h1>
    <p> My favourite hobby is <strong>chess</strong>, because it is a fun way to keep your mind <em>sharp</em>, and you don't need to be good at anything in particular to play with someone. 
        <br> Chess originated in India before spreading to Persia where the term 'checkmate' was coined from the Persian phrase 'shah mat' (the king is dead) 
        <br> Here are some fun facts about chess! 
    <ul> 
        <li> Chess is over <strong>1,500</strong> years old! </li>
        <li> There are more possible chess games than atoms in the universe!</li>
        <li> The longest game of chess lasted 20 hours!</li></ul></p>

<p> I will now tell you how each of the pieces <strong>move</strong>. <br> The pawn only moves forward, but captures <em>diagonally</em>. 
<br> The knight moves 2 squares straight, and 1 square to either the left or right, making an 'L' shape. The knight also has the ability to jump over pieces, hence it's shape, a horse. 
<br> The bishop moves in diagonals, diagonally moving on squares the color of the square it started on. 
<br> The rook moves forward, backward, left and right on any color square. 
<br> The queen is the most valuable piece because it can move like a bishop and a rook, but if a queen started on a black square, by using its rook movement, it can also go along white square diagonals by moving to a white square and then doing bishop movement.
<br> The king can move just like the queen, but only 1 square. If the king is attacked in a way that cannot be defended, it is known as <strong>checkmate</strong></p>

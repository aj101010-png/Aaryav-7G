    <h1>My Hobby</h1>
    <p> My favourite hobby is chess, because it is a fun way to keep your mind sharp, and you don't need to be good at anything in particular to play with someone. <br> Chess originated in India before spreading to Persia where the term 'checkmate' was coined from the Persian phrase 'shah mat' (the king is dead) <br> Here are some fun facts about chess! </p>
